# a note on usage
This repository is structured in a way as to allow it to be imported with the standard go tools. Everything I put here will be well tested and I will fix bugs as I find them. That being said, I created this repo as a way to share ideas and allow other to review simple examples. I don't recommend actually importing this as a dependency. Rather if you see something here that would be useful, you should copy and paste just what you need and make it your own.
