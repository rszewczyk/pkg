utilities and example code in go

# a note on usage
This repository is structured in a way as to allow it to be imported with the standard go tools. Everything I put here will be well tested and I will fix bugs as I find them. That being said, I created this repo as a way to share ideas and allow others to review my code. If you see something here that would be useful, you may want to consider making it your own by copy and pasting it into your own utility library.
